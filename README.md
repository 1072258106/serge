__Serge__ *(String Extraction and Resource Generation Engine)* helps you
set up a seamless continuous localization process for your software
in a fully automated and scalable fashion. It allows developers to
concentrate on maintaining resource files in just one language (e.g. English),
and will take care of keeping all localized resources in sync and translated.

Serge is developed and maintained by Evernote, where it works non-stop
to help deliver various Evernote clients, websites and marketing materials
in 25 languages.
