        - On OS X, expand `~` to the actual `$HOME` path in SQLite DB connection string (#1)

        - Accept multiple `message` entries in append_hint_message plugin (#2)

        - Require JSON::XS (#3)

        - Make serge and tools fine their libs when they are symlinked (#4)

        - Fixed: Uppercase letters in language names are unsupported (#5)

        - Accept multiple `command` entries in run_command plugin (#6)

        - parse_android plugin now supports `serge import` mode
          (generates string keys for alignment) (#7)

        - parse_pot plugin now supports `serge import` mode
          (generates string keys for alignment) (#8)

        - Fix performance when `reuse_uncertain` mode is off (#9)

        - parse_xliff plugin now supports `serge import` mode

        - Parsers are now aware when they are used in import mode, and can adjust their
          behavior accordingly; one can now run `serge test-parser --import-mode <...>`
          to test parsers in import mode.

        - Added the ability to specify any arbitrary class name and plugin data for
          `test-parser` command, which allows one to use this command for any
          custom plugins.

        - Added support for %OUTFILE% and %OUTPATH% macros in `run_command` plugin;
          other macros like %FILE% now work consistently with the rest of the config code

        - Fixed some tests due to broken source files

        - Fixed a regression with job's `active` parameter not defaulting to `YES`

        - Added `feature_branch` plugin that allows one add strings from multiple sources
          (branches) and exclude duplicate strings.

        - Added `log_translation` callback that allows one to log/cache translations

        - String context and key is now passed in `can_extract` callback

        - String key is now passed in `get_translation` and `get_translation_pre` callbacks

        - `test_language` plugin was improved: it now handles URLs better (doesn't try to
          transliterate them), it allows string expansion (disabled by default),
          and transliteration can now be optionally turned off (it is enabled by default)

        - `completeness` plugin has got a new `exclude_languages` option the allows to
          skip its logic for certain languages (this is primarily useful for
          pseudo-localization, see `test_language` plugin)

        - Fixed typos in embedded documentation
